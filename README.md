# VPREMARS
Preliminary density, P wave and S wave models radially through Mars. 

Each .py file is written as a standalone and requires the file indicated (either marsdensity.txt, 
marsswave.txt or marspwave.txt) to run successfully. 

Data is approximate as no model is sufficiently accurate as yet. The data was gathered by using a
digitiser (GetData Graph Digitizer, http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/) and the models provided by
